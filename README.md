# Resources
Here are some resources that have been valuable in my Kubernetes learning journey:

- [Kubernetes Official Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/): The official documentation provides comprehensive information about Kubernetes concepts and features.

- [Kubernetes بالعربي](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX1bW_GeBRhDCHijCrMO5F-oHg52rRBpl):This YouTube playlist is a great starting point for understanding Kubernetes in Arabic.

- [Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_o8dwzRlu4): A YouTube playlist for setting up Kubernetes from scratch and understand k8s Architecture.
